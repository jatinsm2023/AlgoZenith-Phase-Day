### Description
You are given a string S with length N. Each character is assigned a cost for removing it. Find the minimum cost for removing characters such that it does not contain any subsequence ‘hard’.

### Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains a string S.

The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - the cost of removing a character.

### Output Format
For each test case, print the minimum cost for removing characters such that it does not contain any subsequence ‘hard’.

### Constraints
- 1≤ T ≤ 1000

- 1≤ N ≤ 10^5

- 1≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
