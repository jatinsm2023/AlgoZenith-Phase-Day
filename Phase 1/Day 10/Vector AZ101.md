# Description
You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

- add x - add element x at the end of vector
- remove - delete last element of the vector, if vector is not empty
- print x - print the x-th character of the vector, if it exists, otherwise print 0. (0-indexing)
- clear - empty the vector


## Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.

## Output Format
For each test case, print the required queries.

## Constraints
1≤ T ≤ 10^6

1≤ Q ≤ 10^6

1≤ X ≤ 10^6

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
